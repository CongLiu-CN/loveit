> For anyone who is curious about how I became who I am today, here is the answer.

It is a story about me, a young man born and raised in China, managed to land his dream job as a developer in Canada.

# Where It Begins

From 2012 to 2016, I was studying Environmental Protection Equipment Engineering at China University of Petroleum 
. During the entire four years, I haven't figured out what I would like to do with my life. So, I went on a traditional path in China - working after what I have learned in university - as an assistant engineer at a constructional power plant. After working one month, I realized this is something I hate to do, so I reached out to one of my schoolmates at U of Petroleum and got an referral into the chemical plant in Singapore. 

In late 2016, I landed in Singapore working as a shift chemical technician for 18 months. Living in a developed country is a life changing experience. I realized the huge difference in every aspect of life between Singapore and China. In 2018, I decided to change my career into the IT field, therefore I quit the job and went back to China.

# The Plan of becoming a developer in North America

To make my dream come true, I designed a plan that divides the goal into some actionable items.

- Research a path to make the career change and become a Permanent Resident
- Improving English
- Improving CS Domain Knowledge
- Saving money to pay tuition
- Becoming a full time developer
