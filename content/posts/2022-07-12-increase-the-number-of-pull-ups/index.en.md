I used to think there was no talent for sports in me.

For me, life before primary school wasn't that much fun. I had always been locked inside my bedroom because my parents had to work outside all day.

Sometimes, my mother worried about me and would rush back home to check whether I was chill. Not willing to disturb me with her existence, she would lean towards the window of my room. It was a relief to see me enjoying my time with toys and murmuring to me.

Based on that, you can probably see no talent in me for sports. Even though I had worked in a factory for almost two years and improved my body to a new level, I wasn't satisfied.
